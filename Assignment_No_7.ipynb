        "Preventing unintended escape sequence interpretation: Regular expressions often contain backslashes () to define special characters or escape sequences. However, Python also uses backslashes for its own escape sequences (e.g., '\\n' for a newline). Using a raw string in a regular expression prevents Python from interpreting the backslashes as escape sequences before they are processed by the regex engine. This ensures that the backslashes are treated as literal characters, which is crucial for accurate pattern matching.\n",
